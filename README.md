 Full Portfolio Website


Things I learned in here:
1. Hamburger Menu
2. Build body first -> then build nav last, since nav is the hardest part to build.
3. Always create fixed variables, so it will be easy to maintain websites later.
4. Name similar elements same class name
5. Structure of a css file.
